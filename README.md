# SEC-10-K-Section-Scrapping

This code will help you scrap different sections of the cleaned version of the SEC filed 10-K reports. It is set to scrap item 7 (MDA) by default, but can also scrap item 8 (Fianncial Statements - NTFS) by uncommenting some sections of the code. 

This program requires you to have already downloaded the cleaned version of the 10-Ks from https://sraf.nd.edu/sec-edgar-data/cleaned-10x-files/ It also requires that you have all the files you would like to scrap in one folder provided at the beginning of the program. 

Please note that program saves each file by including the reported date (which is different from the filing date in the original file names). This will help researchers track the actual reporting year as against the filing year (which may differ).
